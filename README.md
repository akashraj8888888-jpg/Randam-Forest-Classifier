Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble machine learning algorithm used for classification problems.
It builds multiple decision trees using random samples of the dataset and random feature selection.
The final class is predicted by majority voting from all individual trees.
This approach improves accuracy and reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
Random Forest Classifier works well with large datasets and complex, non-linear relationships.
